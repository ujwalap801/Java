## In Java, literals are fixed values that are assigned directly to variables or constants in the code. They represent the actual value that a variable holds at runtime. Java supports several types of literals, each corresponding to a different data type.

Here are the common types of literals in Java:

# Integer Literals
These are whole numbers without any decimal point.

Example: 10, -5, 0
You can also represent integers in different number systems:

Decimal (Base 10): 42
Binary (Base 2): 0b1010 (prefix 0b or 0B)
Octal (Base 8): 052 (prefix 0)
Hexadecimal (Base 16): 0x2A (prefix 0x or 0X)

# Floating-Point Literals
These are numbers with a decimal point.

Example: 3.14, -0.001, 6.022E23 (scientific notation)
Character Literals
These represent single characters enclosed in single quotes (').

Example: 'a', 'Z', '1'
Special characters can also be represented using escape sequences:

Example: '\n' (newline), '\t' (tab), '\'' (single quote)

# String Literals
These represent sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes (").

Example: "Hello, World!", "123"

# Boolean Literals
These represent the logical values true or false.

Example: true, false

# Null Literal
The null literal represents the absence of any object or value.

Example: null
Example Code:

int a = 10;                // Integer literal
double b = 3.14;           // Floating-point literal
char c = 'A';              // Character literal
String str = "Hello";      // String literal
boolean flag = true;       // Boolean literal
Object obj = null;         // Null literal


# Each literal directly represents its corresponding value in memory, and they play a fundamental role in how data is handled in Java programs.
