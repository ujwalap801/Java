# Array Operations in Java

This repository contains examples of various array operations in Java. Each example demonstrates different techniques for working with arrays.

## Array Declaration and Initialization

Defines and initializes an array with specific values.

## Accessing and Modifying Elements

Shows how to retrieve and change elements using index.

## Iterating Through Arrays

Demonstrates looping techniques (for and enhanced for loops) to iterate over array elements.

## Finding Length

Retrieves the number of elements in the array.

## Sorting

Sorts array elements in ascending order using Arrays.sort().

## Searching

Implements a linear search algorithm to find an element in the array.

## Copying Arrays

Copies elements from one array to another using System.arraycopy().

## Manipulating Arrays

Illustrates manipulation of array elements using System.arraycopy().

## Updating an Element in an Array

To update (or modify) an element in an array, you simply assign a new value to the desired index of the array.

In Java, arrays have a fixed size once they are initialized, which means the number of elements cannot be changed dynamically after creation. However, you can update and delete elements within the existing size of the array using specific techniques.
