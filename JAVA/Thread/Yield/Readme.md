# Understanding `yield()` in Java Threads

## Overview

- **Yield()**: This method stops the currently executing thread and gives a chance to other threads for execution.

## Method Signature

```java
public static native void yield();


Key Points
The yield() method provides a hint to the thread scheduler, allowing it to decide whether to pause the current thread and let other threads execute.
The thread scheduler may accept or ignore this hint, so the actual output or behavior may vary.
Important Note
The output of using yield() may differ depending on the implementation of the thread scheduler in the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
