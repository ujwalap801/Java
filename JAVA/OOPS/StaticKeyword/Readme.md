## Static Keyword in Java

The `static` keyword is a non-access modifier used in Java for memory management. It can be applied to:

1. **Variables (Class Level)**
   - Static variables are used for memory management and cannot be applied to local variables.

2. **Methods**
   - Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.

3. **Blocks**
   - Static blocks are used for static initializations of a class.

4. **Inner Classes (Nested Classes)**
   - The `static` keyword can be used with inner classes (nested classes) but not with outer classes.
