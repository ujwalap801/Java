# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm

A paradigm can also be termed as a method to solve a problem or perform a task. A programming paradigm is an approach to solving problems using some programming language. It is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm/methodology.

## Six Pillars of OOP

1. **Class**
2. **Object**
3. **Inheritance**
4. **Polymorphism**
5. **Abstraction**
6. **Encapsulation**

### Class

1. A class is a collection of objects.
2. A class is not a real-world entity. It is just a template, blueprint, or prototype.
3. A class does not occupy memory.

#### Syntax:
```java
access.modifier class ClassName {
    // methods
    // constructors
    // fields
    // blocks
    // nested class
}

## Method

A set of code that performs a particular task.

### Advantages of Methods:
- Code reusability
- Code optimization

### syntax:
access.modifier return.type methodName(list of parameters) {
    // method body
}

## Object

An object is an instance of a class.
An object is a real-world entity.
An object occupies memory.
An object consists of:

- **Identity:** Name
- **State/Attribute:** Color, breed, age
- **Behavior:** Eat, run

### How to create an object:
- Using the `new` keyword
- Using the `clone()` method
- Using the `newInstance()` method
- Through deserialization and factory methods

### Object instantiation:
- By reference variable
- By using a method
- By using a constructor
