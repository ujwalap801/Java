# Java Keywords

Java has a set of reserved keywords that are predefined and have special meanings. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (names for variables, methods, classes, etc.). Below is a list of Java keywords:

| `import`       | Imports other classes or packages.                   |
| `instanceof`   | Tests whether an object is an instance of a specific class or interface. |
| `int`          | Used to declare a variable of type int (32-bit integer). |
| `interface`    | Declares an interface.                               |
| `long`         | Used to declare a variable of type long (64-bit integer). |
| `native`       | Specifies that a method is implemented in native code using JNI (Java Native Interface). |
| `new`          | Creates new objects.                                 |
| `null`         | A literal representing a null reference.             |
| `package`      | Defines a package, which is a namespace for classes. |
| `private`      | Specifies that a member is accessible only within its own class. |
| `protected`    | Specifies that a member is accessible within its own package and by subclasses. |
| `public`       | Specifies that a member is accessible from any other class. |
| `return`       | Exits from the current method and optionally returns a value. |
| `short`        | Used to declare a variable of type short (16-bit integer). |
| `static`       | Indicates that a member belongs to the class, rather than instances of the class. |
| `strictfp`     | Used to restrict floating-point calculations to ensure portability. |
| `super`        | Refers to the superclass of the current object.      |
| `switch`       | Defines a switch statement.                           |
| `synchronized` | Used in thread programming to restrict access to a method or block to one thread at a time. |
| `this`         | Refers to the current instance of a class.          |
| `throw`        | Used to explicitly throw an exception.               |
| `throws`       | Declares the exceptions that a method can throw.    |

| `void`         | Indicates that a method does not return a value.     |
| `volatile`     | Indicates that a variable's value will be modified by different threads. |

## Note
- The keywords `const` and `goto` are reserved but not used in Java.
