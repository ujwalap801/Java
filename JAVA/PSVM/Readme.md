## Explanation of `public static void main(String[] args)`


we can have many java class 
we can have only one public class in  a java program


### public
**Access Modifier**: `public` is an access modifier that means this method is accessible from anywhere. In the context of the main method, it means that the Java runtime can call this method from outside the class when the program starts.

### static
**Static Method**: `static` means that this method belongs to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class. This allows the Java runtime to call the main method without needing to create an instance of the class. The main method is the entry point of the program, so it must be accessible without creating an object.

### void
**Return Type**: `void` means that this method does not return any value. The main method is designed to perform actions (like running the application) rather than compute and return a value.

### main
**Method Name**: `main` is the name of the method that the Java runtime looks for when it starts a program. It is a special method in Java that serves as the entry point of any Java application.

### String[] args
**Parameter**: This is an array of `String` objects, named `args`. It represents the command-line arguments that are passed to the program when it is run. Each element of the array is one of the arguments provided on the command line.

- **String**: The type of the array elements, which are strings.
- **[]**: Indicates that `args` is an array.
- **args**: The name of the array variable that holds the command-line arguments.
