# Data Types in Java

A data type is a label that defines what kind of data a variable can hold, how much space it will take up in memory, and what operations can be performed on it. 

## Primitive Data Types

Primitive Data Types:
Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data in Java. They are not objects and hold their values directly. 

In Java, there are 8 primitive data types:

1. **byte**: 8-bit integer
2. **short**: 16-bit integer
3. **int**: 32-bit integer
4. **long**: 64-bit integer
5. **float**: 32-bit floating-point
6. **double**: 64-bit floating-point
7. **char**: single character
8. **boolean**: true or false


byte: 1 byte
boolean: 1 byte

short: 2 bytes
char: 2 bytes

int: 4 bytes
float: 4 bytes

long: 8 bytes
double: 8 bytes



## Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-Primitive Data Types:
Non-primitive data types, also known as reference data types, are more complex. They are created from primitive data types and can hold multiple values or more complex data. 

Here are the non-primitive data types in Java:

1. **String**: a sequence of characters, like "Hello", "Goodbye", etc.
2. **Arrays**: collections of values of the same type, like int[], String[], etc.
3. **Classes (Objects)**: user-defined data types, like Employee, Student, etc.
4. **Interfaces**: abstract definitions of methods and variables, like Serializable, Comparable, etc.
5. **Enums**: enumerations of named values, like Color.RED, Color.GREEN, etc.
6. **Collections**: data structures like List, Set, Map, etc., that store and manage groups of objects.
7. **Abstract Classes**: classes that can't be instantiated, but serve as base classes for others.

These non-primitive data types are used to create more complex and abstract data structures, and are a key part of Java's object-oriented programming (OOP) model.

## Recap

- **8 primitive data types**: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
- **7 non-primitive data types**: String, Arrays, Classes (Objects), Interfaces, Enums, Collections, Abstract Classes
