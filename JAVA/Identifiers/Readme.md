# Identifiers in Java are names given to elements such as classes, methods, variables, and labels. They are essential for distinguishing one entity from another in your code. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive overview of identifiers in Java, including their rules, examples, and best practices.

## Rules for Naming Identifiers
# Valid Characters:
Identifiers can consist of letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).
They must begin with a letter, an underscore, or a dollar sign. They cannot start with a digit.

# Case Sensitivity:
Identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, myVariable, MyVariable, and MYVARIABLE are considered different identifiers.

# Length:
There is no explicit limit to the length of an identifier, but it should be kept reasonably short and meaningful.
Keywords:

# Identifiers cannot be Java keywords or reserved words (e.g., int, class, if, etc.).
